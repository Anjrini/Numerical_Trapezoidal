## Numerical Integration using the Trapezoidal rule

The implementation of this script is do get the integration of a function bounded between two limits. It is often not that easy to compute the integration. However, using this numerical method, we can approximate it.

## Libraries:

```
import numpy as np
```

## The Funtion

the function is defined as follows:
```
Trap(a,b,fun)
```
where:
- a: the lower bound of the integral
- b: the upper bound of the integral
- fun: the function we're gunna integrate

## Input of the Script

```
line24,      a=?    please change it accordingly
line 25,     b=?    please change it accordingly
line 29+30,  fun=?  please modify it accordingly
```

## Exmaple

> I have provided an example of the Frensel Integartion running from a=0 and b=1000 in order to just show a comparison with the actual value $$\sqrt{pi/8}$$
